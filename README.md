# PETRY-ROSIE-SINEX-PLLC
Files from a web fundamentals project I coded at UHCL, my website was chosen by this firm and became their website.
This includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the documents were not linked because we were using code pen to visualize and VS code to edit.
This is a link of the current website the used out code as a base, the bootstap used was given to us by out dev team and we built from it. https://www.petrysinex.com/
